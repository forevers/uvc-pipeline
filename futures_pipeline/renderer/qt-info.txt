+++++ raw rendering

For advanced usage (like processing viewfinder frames as they come, to detect objects or patterns), 
you can also derive from QAbstractVideoSurface and set that as the viewfinder for the QCamera object. 
In this case you will need to render the viewfinder image yourself.

camera = new QCamera;
mySurface = new MyVideoSurface;
camera->setViewfinder(mySurface);

camera->start();
// MyVideoSurface::present(..) will be called with viewfinder frames

----- raw rendering

+++++ orientation

// Assuming a QImage has been created from the QVideoFrame that needs to be presented
QImage videoFrame;
QCameraInfo cameraInfo(camera); // needed to get the camera sensor position and orientation

// Get the current display orientation
const QScreen *screen = QGuiApplication::primaryScreen();
const int screenAngle = screen->angleBetween(screen->nativeOrientation(), screen->orientation());

int rotation;
if (cameraInfo.position() == QCamera::BackFace) {
    rotation = (cameraInfo.orientation() - screenAngle) % 360;
} else {
    // Front position, compensate the mirror
    rotation = (360 - cameraInfo.orientation() + screenAngle) % 360;
}

// Rotate the frame so it always shows in the correct orientation
videoFrame = videoFrame.transformed(QTransform().rotate(rotation));
